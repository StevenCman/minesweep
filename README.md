# minesweep
Just a crummy version of minesweeper created in my downtime to get back into coding.
 Planning on adding more later just thought i would get the first working version up.
 To use just download the the folder titled "minesweep" and run the exe within. It is terribly optimized now but that comes at a later time :)
