	<h1>Objectives</h1>
	<p>This is a game about clearing out mines in a grid baed system. Every level contains a certain number of mines and clear spaces. The clear spaces will have a number that indicates the number of mines touching one of the 8 spaces around the square<br />
		IE  (x = mines)<br />		x 2 x<br />
							3 5 3<br />
							x x x
	</p>
	<p> The goal is to click all of the spaces that dont contain mines, as you click more safe spaces, you get more information about the remaining mines and can clear more safe spaces. When all safe spaces are revealed, the game ends with your victory, if you hit a mine at any time, it will explode and end the game
	</p>

	<h2>Controls</h2> 						
	<p> The controls are simple:<br /> 
		Left click to reveal a space as a safe space or a mine<br />
		Right click to predict where a mine is, it will change the square to an orange colour and say flag to help remember where you think the mines are<br />
		Left click the hint button at any time to reveal a free space randomly, it wont work to reveal the last square however
	</p>	
	<h3>Tips</h3>
	<p> Always start with the 4 corners of the square, they will always be a free space and at least one of them should lead to an easier start </p>
	<p> If you reveal a square with a 0 in it, it will also reveal every square around it until there is a mine</p>
